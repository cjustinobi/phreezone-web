            Lots of people has lost interest in investing their time, money, and energy in multi level marketing
            platforms apparently
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to so many ill-experiences they have had in one or more of such businesses
            which they had ventured into in the past.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking back over the years, people have witnessed many companies which came with lots of promises which
            attracted lots of people to them only for some of those companies to either use high and near un-realizeable
            targets/high price to deny it's members such promises or will be so dubious enough not fulfill such promises.
          </p>
          <p>
            Research have shown that network marketing is one of the surest way to create very large number of financially
            free individuals within the shortest possible period of time.
            More research have also shown that people who joins multilevel marketing business are highly motivated resilience
            and very determined to achieve their goals.
            However, a greater percentage of these large population starts getting discouraged when after a long period
            of dedicated and obvious hard work has nothing to show for it.
          </p>
          <p>
            If network marketing has the potency of producing higher number of financially free persons,
            Why then are lots of people getting fade up, losing their enthusiasm and have their fire go down??
            Why do many others get angry at  the  mention of the name network marketing??
            These and other questions have continue to be a puzzle which no one has been able solve.
